Valorant is the best game.
Valorant is a free-to-play tactical first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, released in 2020
The game features 5v5 competitive matches with unique character abilities called "Agents"
Valorant combines precise gunplay mechanics similar to Counter-Strike with hero-based abilities like Overwatch
There are four main Agent classes: Duelist (entry fraggers), Initiator (intel gatherers), Controller (map control), and Sentinel (defenders)
The main game mode is "Plant/Defuse" where attackers plant a Spike (bomb) and defenders try to prevent or defuse it
Valorant uses a sophisticated anti-cheat system called Vanguard that runs at kernel level
The game features a ranking system from Iron to Radiant, with Radiant being the highest competitive tier
Valorant has a thriving esports scene with the VCT (Valorant Champions Tour) featuring regional leagues and international tournaments
The game monetizes through cosmetic skins, battle passes, and Agent unlocks - no pay-to-win mechanics
Communication and teamwork are essential - the game includes voice chat, text chat, and a ping system for callouts
